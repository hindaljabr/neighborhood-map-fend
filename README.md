# Neighborhood Map FEND Project

## Qusoor District Map
Qusoor district page displays the map of said district, it shows a list of a few spots in there.
I included a cool article about the history of the spot a user chooses to display, for example; if you choose 'Smoothie Factory'; the information window would show a link to an article about Smoothies!
The webpage is fully responsive, a clickable burger menu would should for smaller screens.

## Get Started
1. Clone or download repo.
2. Run index.html in your browser.
3. Choose spots from the list, or click the pins directly, you can also search in the search field!
